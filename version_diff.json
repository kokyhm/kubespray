It includes a fix for a low severity security issue\r\n(CVE-2024-45310) as well as some minor build-related fixes (including Go\r\n1.23 support).\r\n\r\n * Fix [CVE-2024-45310][cve-2024-45310], a low-severity attack that allowed\r\n   maliciously configured containers to create empty files and directories on\r\n   the host.\r\n * Add support for Go 1.23. (#4360, #4372)\r\n * Revert \"allow overriding VERSION value in Makefile\" and add EXTRA_VERSION.\r\n   (#4370, #4382)\r\n * rootfs: consolidate mountpoint creation logic.
